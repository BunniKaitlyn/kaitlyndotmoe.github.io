## [Guide] Bypassing Fortnite Android "Input Error"
***Reminder that this requires being rooted (with Magisk), currently there is no method for unrooted users!***

1. Install systemless Xposed Framework from Magisk and Xposed Installer (for Magisk), enable it in Magisk modules and restart.
2. Download the [FakeFortnite](https://github.com/Cyuubi/FakeFortnite/releases/tag/1.0) Xposed module APK and install it.
3. Enable the FakeFortnite Xposed Framework module and restart.
4. Open Fortnite, go into a match and you should get a VPN error.
5. Close Fortnite and uninstall Xposed Installer.
6. Open Fortnite again, go into a match and if you did everything correctly you shouldn't get kicked off the Battle Bus.

# Q&A
Q: When I restart my phone and go into Fortnite again, I get the "Input Error". Why?<br>
A: Reinstall Xposed Installer (for Magisk), enable FakeFortnite again and restart. Open Fortnite, go into a match and you should get a VPN error. Uninstall Xposed Installer again, open Fortnite again and if you did everything correctly you shouldn't get kicked off the Battle Bus. You will have to constantly do this every time you reboot, I'm looking into a way to make it so that Fortnite can't detect Xposed Installer.
